Handle missing values and perform data cleaning if necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze the distribution of calorie counts across menu items.

Explore the nutritional content (e.g., fat, protein, carbohydrates) of different items.

Identify trends and patterns in the dataset.

**Data Visualization**

Create bar charts, histograms, and box plots to visualize calorie distribution and nutritional content.

Compare nutritional characteristics of different food categories (e.g., burgers, salads, desserts).

Nutrition-Based Insights
